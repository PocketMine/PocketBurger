## PocketBurger

PocketBurger is a "port" of Burger (in fact, just a fast-coded program that works like it) used to extract information from Minecraft: Pocket Edition releases.

It needs an ASM output using IDA from the libminecraftpe.so from the Android APK.


### Usage

`php munch.php [options] libminecraftpe.asm`

Options: [Check Burger](https://github.com/mcdevs/Burger/). No --download or -d
